Certainly! Here's a simple `README.md` file that describes the basic structure and usage of your Flask app based on the file structure you’ve shared:

# Flask To-Do App

This is a simple To-Do list application built using Flask, a lightweight Python web framework. The app allows users to create, read, update, and delete tasks. 

## Project Structure

Here is a brief overview of the project's structure:

```
├── pycache/             # Compiled bytecode files (generated automatically)
├── instance/             # Holds instance-specific configuration (e.g. production settings)
├── myenv/                # Python virtual environment for project dependencies
├── static/               # Static files such as CSS, JavaScript, and images
├── templates/            # HTML templates for rendering views
├── app.py                # Main application file that contains the Flask app
├── requirements.txt      # List of project dependencies
└── test.py               # Unit tests for the app
```

## Installation

To get started with this app, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/hitesh-mungara/Todo-Flask.git
    cd <repository-directory>
    ```

2. **Create a virtual environment:**

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv myenv
    ```

3. **Activate the virtual environment:**

    - On Windows:

        ```bash
        myenv\Scripts\activate
        ```

    - On macOS/Linux:

        ```bash
        source myenv/bin/activate
        ```

4. **Install the dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Running the App

To run the Flask app locally, execute the following command:

```bash
python app.py
```

This will start a development server on `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` (or another available port).

## Testing

The project includes some basic unit tests that are located in `test.py`. To run the tests, you can use the following command:

```bash
python -m unittest test.py
```

## Project Features

- **Create, read, update, and delete tasks**.
- Tasks are stored in memory (you can extend this with a database in the future).
- Uses Jinja templating for dynamic HTML rendering.
- Basic CSS and JavaScript for user interface.

## Dependencies

- Flask (specified in `requirements.txt`)
- Any other dependencies specified in the `requirements.txt` file.
